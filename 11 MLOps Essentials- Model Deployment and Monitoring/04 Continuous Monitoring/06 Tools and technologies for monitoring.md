Tools and technologies for monitoring
- [Instructor] Let's briefly review the tools and technologies that can be used for monitoring ML solutions. For system and application monitoring, a number of tools are available for instrumentation and collection of telemetry data. They include Kubernetes, Prometheus, the ELK stack, Fluentd, and Grafana. There are also other commercial providers like Datadog, New Relic, and Sensu who provide monitoring as a service. For monitoring ML models, there are products for monitoring, like Seldon Core and Fiddler. ML monitoring services are also available from Arize AI, Neptune, Evidently AI, and New Relic. This is an immature and fast evolving space, so do your own due diligence in choosing the right services for your own use case.
