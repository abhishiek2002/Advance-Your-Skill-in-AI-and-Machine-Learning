MLOps vs. GenAIOps
As discussed in the previous video, MLOps is a discipline focused on automating and managing the lifecycle of traditional machine learning models. It extends DevOps to add ML model management.

GenAIOps extends MLOps practices to the unique demands of generative AI systems, which are built around large language models (LLMs) or other foundation models. Unlike traditional ML, GenAI introduces challenges like managing prompts, controlling hallucinations, evaluating open-ended outputs, and implementing guardrails. GenAIOps must handle unstructured data (for example, text, code, or images), coordinate retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), fine-tune or adapt foundation models, and support human-in-the-loop evaluation. It adds on vector databases and agentic tools as elements that need to be built, tested, and deployed. This course focuses on MLOps. Learners are highly recommended to take the GenAIOps Foundations courses to learn about systems and processes specific to GenAI.
