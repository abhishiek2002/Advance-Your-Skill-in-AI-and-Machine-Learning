7 to 10 network GUI demo
- [Instructor] All right. Now let's look at the one hot and coding model, the seven to 10 network. Notice that we have the same controls except for the raw output, which is now showing us 10 raw outputs. That is one output per class. So remember, the output with the highest value will be the one reported as the recognized number. Let me train this network for 1000 epochs. So again, let's see if it recognizes number three correctly. How about number five? Now, let's see, number seven. So far, so good. Let's see how tolerant to small changes this classifier is. As you can see, I am entering nearly zeros and nearly ones. And the recognized number remained a solid seven. So as you can see, this is way more tolerant than the seven to one network. And now for the zero to eight and back test, let me set up the segment. Here, we have the pattern for zero. Now, before I slide the middle segment remember that there's no reason for the output to show anything other than zero and eight. So let's see it. There you have it. So, now it feels like we are using a neural network free from the shackles of a forced sequence in the trained patterns.
