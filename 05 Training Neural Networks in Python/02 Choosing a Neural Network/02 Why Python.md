Why Python
- [Instructor] I'd like to take a moment to tell you why we chose Python as the programing language for this course. So here are some of the most important aspects about Python I'd like you to know. First, Python is undoubtedly one of the most popular programming languages today. It has a very convenient syntax for machine learning, especially because of the mathematical capabilities already embedded in the language. There are lots of libraries available for pretty much any application in machine learning, and this includes lots of neural network variants. Lastly, Python is a very friendly language when it comes to porting your code from one platform to another. So I feel pretty confident when I say that you'll be able to run your code anywhere. That's why I don't expect you to have any platform-related trouble when setting up your environment or trying out your code.
