What you should know
- [Instructor] Before we start, here are some things you should know. First and foremost, you must feel comfortable with writing code in Python 3. If you're not sure, I suggest that you give it a try until you reach the first programming exercise. If you still need some training, go ahead and browse our library to choose one of our many courses on Python. Second, you may run the exercise files using a GitHub code space, which is a nice cloud development environment for you to test your code without having to install anything. We'll tell you more about this later. In case you prefer to run the code in your computer, you'll need to have Python 3 installed with the NumPy library. Also, for the final project, I will show you an application with a graphical user interface that uses the Tkinter package, which probably came with your Python distribution. In the GitHub Codespace, you will use the cloud version of Visual Studio Code, but I also recommend that you install this IDE in your computer if you intend to run the code locally. We'll be discussing functions like summations and exponentials, so having experience with that level of mathematics will be helpful.
