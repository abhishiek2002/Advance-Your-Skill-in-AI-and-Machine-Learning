Creating a neural network in Python
- Neural networks are everywhere and chances are you are using them every day when you're shopping online and a product you like pops up, when you see a weather forecast and why not, when you use your smartphone. I'm Eduardo Corpeno and I'd like to invite you to take this course where we will create a neural network from scratch in Python. Whether you are starting your journey into artificial intelligence and machine learning or you have some experience using neural networks with popular tools like PyTorch or TensorFlow and you'd like to brush up on the basics, this course is for you. Although professional tools allow you to train neural networks from a high-level perspective, the objective of this course is to give you a chance to tap into the details of the algorithms behind neural networks. This will allow you to fully understand what's going on inside and you'll make much better use of professional machine learning tools in the future. So come join me in my LinkedIn learning course and let's have fun with neural networks and Python.
