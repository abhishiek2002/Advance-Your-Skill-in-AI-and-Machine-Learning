Introduction to AI experts
Think about the last time you looked for a job. AI is increasingly used in every facet of the hiring process, from writing the job description to filtering the pool of candidates. And even after a job offer, influencing your salary, promotions, and more. Were you aware that AI may determine whether you even see a job opening in the first place? Similarly, consider how Twitter decided to crop the photo of your face, or how Facebook decides which updates to show you, and how doctors might quickly analyze medical images and narrow down potential diagnoses with the aid of AI. Have you noticed that in some buildings, the thermostat learns to turn on in anticipation of staff arriving, and turn off if no one comes in? In this chapter, we hear from experts to get a better understanding of the benefits and risks of using AI in the influential domains of human resources, social media, healthcare, and climate resilience.
