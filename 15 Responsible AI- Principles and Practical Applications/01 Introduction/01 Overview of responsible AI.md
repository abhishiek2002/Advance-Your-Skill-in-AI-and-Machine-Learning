Overview of responsible AI
Whether you're a sponsor, developer, or user of artificial intelligence tools in your work or organization, you should be aware not only of their benefits, but also of potential unintended consequences. By raising your awareness of how AI is being used and how to mitigate risks associated with it, you can promote the responsible use of AI while reaping its benefits. In this LinkedIn learning course, you'll learn from examples of how AI is used in various application domains, such as human resources, social media, and healthcare, why it is important to have guiding principles and to adopt best practices for responsible AI. You'll also be equipped with knowledge for assessing and addressing risks in order to minimize unintended consequences of artificial intelligence. My name is Sujai King Liu, and I'm the Dean of the College of Engineering at the University of California, Berkeley, where researchers are advancing the forefront of AI technology and policy. I invite you to join me in this course to learn how you can support the responsible usage of AI.
