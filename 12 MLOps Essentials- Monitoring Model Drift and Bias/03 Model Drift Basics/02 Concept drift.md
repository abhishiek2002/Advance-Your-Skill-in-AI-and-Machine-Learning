Concept drift
- [Instructor] There are two types of drifts that can happen in machine learning, namely Concept Drift and Feature Drift. Let's discuss concept drift in this video. A machine learning model essentially captures the relationship between the features and the target, and uses this information to make predictions. A concept drift occurs when the relationship between the features and the target changes over time. As a result, the model is no longer able to predict accurately, and needs to be retrained. In the formal of our conditional probability of Y given X, when the joint probability of X and Y changes, concept drift occurs. For example, let's say in the real world a patient has diabetes 80% of the time when their age is greater than 50. A model built on such data will also predict the same. Let's say for five months the ground truth holds good, and the model predicts with the same level of accuracy. By the sixth month, a new medication for diabetes lowers (indistinct) levels and changes the probability of being diabetic when the age is greater than 50 to just 50%. The old model built on the old data will continue to predict that 80% of those above 50 as diabetic, and hence will turn inaccurate, this is concept drift.
