Drift remediation process
- [Instructor] How do we detect and fix drift issues with our models? Let's look at a typical drift remediation process. It starts with detecting drift in the models in production. For these, we need to add instrumentation to our models to collect necessary data. We may have to add manual or automated labeling to understand the ground truth. Based on this, we need to set up drift tracking processes and pipelines and analyze drift periodically. Then we get to identifying the root causes of drift. For this, we analyze the changes in relationships between the feature and the target variables in the ecosystem. We additionally explore input data issues in production and possible training data issues. Once the root causes identified, we need to fix the issue. This may include augmenting or replacing the current training datasets. We would also have to retrain the model with this updated training dataset. We may have to also fix other application issues that may be causing issues with input data. Having discussed the concepts around drift, let's analyze drift with some examples in the next chapter.
