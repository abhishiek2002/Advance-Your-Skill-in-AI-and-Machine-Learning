Protected attributes
- [Instructor] Having discussed some background on bias and fairness in machine learning, let's discuss some key concepts. The first one is the protected attribute. What are protected attributes in business? These are the features, characteristics, identities or traits of an individual that should not be used for making business decisions. While there are some common lists of such features, the list would vary based on the organization and based on the use case. This list of features is selected based on legal or regulatory requirements, ethical guidance, or organizational policies. The organization may still collect this information, but these will not be used for any kind of decision-making, either by humans or machine learning models. Here is a list of key protected attributes: race, religion, gender, age, marital status, and economic status. An attribute may be a protected attribute in some cases, while it may not be in others. For example, economic status would not be considered for making an admission decision in a college, but can be used for deciding on a scholarship.
