Fairness in ML
- [Instructor] How do we ensure fairness in the models we build based on real world data? Let's first define fairness in machine learning. Fairness in machine learning is the process of ensuring that the model provides all individuals with equal opportunity and does not bias or generalize based on certain demographics or traits. Why is it important to ensure fairness in machine learning? It helps build trust with the customers. When customers believe that the product behaves in a fair manner and does not discriminate, it builds confidence in the product, and hence, brings in more revenue. Fairness helps build and maintain the reputation of the organization in the public eye. This, again, is important in growing the business. Several legal and regulatory requirements exist around fairness. Adherence to these requirements avoids legal issues and monetary penalties for the organization. In this and the next chapter, we will introduce the basic concepts around bias and fairness, and also demonstrate how to monitor bias using popular open source libraries.
