Software for drift detection
- [Instructor] There are several out-of-the-box drift detection products and libraries that are available for detecting drift. Let's quickly explore a few of them. Machine learning platforms like AWS, GCP, and Ajar have their own drift detection capabilities. Seldon.io is an open-source software that contains the alibi-detect library, which can be used for drift detection. TorchDrift is available in PyTorch for drift detection. Scikit-multiflow can also help with drift detection. TensorFlow data validation helps to detect drift in TensorFlow-related use cases. There are of course a number of commercial MLOps offerings that bundle in drift detection capabilities.
