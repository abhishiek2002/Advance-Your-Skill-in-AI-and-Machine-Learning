Tuning the network
- We begin our optimization exercise, by tuning the number of layers, in the network. This is available in section 5.3 of the notebook. We will start with 32 nodes in a given layer, which we will anyway tune later in this video. Then we build a model, with layer counts one to five. Then we plot the accuracy values and compare. Let's review the results from the results. From the result seen, two layers seem to provide the highest accuracy level, at lower HIPO counts, and we will choose that value for the model. Next, we move on to nodes in a layer. Here, we will try nodes counts from eight to 32, in increments of eight. We will use two hidden layers, which is the value we selected earlier. We'll then build the model, and compare its performance. A node count of 32, seems to achieve, higher levels of accuracy, earlier in the training process. So we will choose 32. We will go with a layer count of two, and 32 nodes in each layer.
