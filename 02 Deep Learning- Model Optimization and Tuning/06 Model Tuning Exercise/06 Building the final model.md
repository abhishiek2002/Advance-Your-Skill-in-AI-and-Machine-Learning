Building the final model
- Now that we have experimented with individual hyperparameters and decided on suitable values for each of them, let's put them all together into a single model and compare. Here, we first create the base minimal model with all the default values. We create and run this model and measure its accuracy. Then, we create a model with all the optimizations we have done and then measure its accuracy too. We will compare them in a graph. Looking at the graph, we see that the optimized model performs better. It was able to achieve higher levels of accuracy earlier in the epoch iterations. One warning I want to provide here though, this is a grossly simplified example with a small amount of training data. Repeating the experiment may not provide the same results. Also, while a hyper parameter value may perform well in an isolated experiments, it may perform badly if combined with certain values of other hyperparameters. So, this is a trial and error process in the real world, and it may take days or even weeks to find the right combination of these parameters. The goal of this course is to discuss the levers, process and template for running such experiments that you can take and use in your use cases.
