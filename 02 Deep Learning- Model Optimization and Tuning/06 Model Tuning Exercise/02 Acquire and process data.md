Acquire and process data
- [Instructor] The code for this exercise is available in the notebook code_05_XX Incident Root Cause Analysis. We will start with acquiring and processing the data for root cause analysis in section 5.2. For this purpose, we have created a method called get_rca_data. This will load up the root cause analysis CSV file. It will then use the label encoder to encode the target variable. We then convert the data set to a numpy array and separate the feature and target variables into separate arrays. The arrays are then returned to the main function. For building the model and plotting the graphs, we will continue to use the common experiment functions. So we will import this notebook at the beginning. For each of these experiments, we will follow the same template that we discussed earlier in the course.
