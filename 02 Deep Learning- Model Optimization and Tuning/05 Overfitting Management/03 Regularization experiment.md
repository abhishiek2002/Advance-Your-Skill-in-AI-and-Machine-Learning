Regularization experiment
- [Instructor] The code for experiments in this chapter are available in the notebook, Code_04_XX Overfitting Management. The regularization experiment is in section 4.3. Here, we are going to compare three options, L1, L2, and L1_L2. We parse them as options when creating hidden layers in Keras. Note that we are comparing validation accuracy for overfitting experiments. Let's run the experiment and review the results. L2 seems to perform better than other algorithms for this use case. For the IDs dataset, the validation dataset is very small, so repeated runs may not have consistent results. In real world experiments, it is recommended to have a larger validation set to achieve consistent results across multiple runs.
