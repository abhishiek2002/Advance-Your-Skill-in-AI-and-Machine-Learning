Dropout experiment
- [Instructor] We will now run the exercise for dropouts in section 4.5 of the notebook. Here, we choose multiple dropout values. 0%, 10%, 20%, and 50%. We then build and run the models for each of them. Switching to the Common_Experiments_Function notebook, we see that a dropout layer will be added between hidden layers if a percentage is set. Switching back, let's run the models and compare the validation accuracies. Let's also plot the graph and examine the results. To begin with, when a dropout is added, we see a dropout layer in the model summary. Looking at the graph, a dropout percentage of 10% seemed to provide the best results for this specific use case. As discussed in the previous video, dropouts can help or hurt a model. In this case, a dropout of 10% seems to be the right value.
