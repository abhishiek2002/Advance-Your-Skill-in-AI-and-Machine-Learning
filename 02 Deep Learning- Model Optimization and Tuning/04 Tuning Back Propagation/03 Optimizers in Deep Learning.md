### Optimizers in Deep Learning

Optimizers are critical components in deep learning that enhance the gradient descent process, enabling faster convergence and improved model performance. The standard gradient descent method can be slow, especially with large datasets and deep neural networks. Optimizers address this by adjusting the parameter updates intelligently to speed up training while mitigating issues like vanishing and exploding gradients.

#### Role of Optimizers

* Speed up the training process.
* Control gradient updates to prevent instability.
* Help the model reach desired parameter values efficiently.

#### Popular Optimizers

1. **SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent)**: Updates parameters using a subset (mini-batch) of the training data for each step.
2. **RMSprop**: Adjusts learning rates for each parameter individually to improve convergence.
3. **Adam**: Combines momentum and adaptive learning rates for robust and fast convergence.
4. **Adagrad**: Adapts learning rates based on parameter updates, suitable for sparse data.

#### Key Points

* Optimizers are applied during backpropagation.
* Most deep learning frameworks like Keras and TensorFlow provide these optimizers out-of-the-box.
* Custom optimizers can also be implemented if needed.

In the next step, we'll experiment with different optimizers to observe their impact on model performance.
