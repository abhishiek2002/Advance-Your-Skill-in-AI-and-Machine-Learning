# Batch Normalization

## Overview

Batch Normalization (BN) is a crucial technique in deep learning to manage vanishing and exploding gradients during the gradient descent process. By normalizing the inputs to each hidden layer, BN ensures that the values are on a consistent scale, which stabilizes training and often improves model accuracy.

## How Batch Normalization Works

1. **Normalization:**

   * Inputs to each hidden layer are normalized using the mean and standard deviation of that layer's outputs.
   * StandardScaler is typically used to center (mean = 0) and scale (variance = 1) the outputs.

2. **Gradient Descent Stabilization:**

   * Even if delta updates and activation functions scale the values up or down, BN normalizes them before sending them to the next layer.
   * This stabilization helps prevent vanishing and exploding gradients, leading to smoother and more efficient training.

3. **Optimization Benefits:**

   * Models often achieve higher accuracy with fewer epochs due to more stable and efficient gradient updates.
   * BN can improve convergence speed and overall training stability.

4. **Trade-offs:**

   * BN introduces additional computations, which may slightly increase training and inference time.
   * It also consumes additional memory for storing the normalization parameters.

## Practical Implementation

* **Experiment Setup:**

  * Two options are commonly compared: `none` (no BN) and `batch` (with BN).
  * BN is added as a layer between the hidden layers in the neural network.

* **Model Summary Observations:**

  * Adding BN introduces an extra layer in the network.
  * Models with BN generally show higher accuracy earlier in training.

* **Performance Results:**

  * Models with BN reach higher accuracy with fewer epochs.
  * The controlled gradient updates result in faster convergence and better overall performance.

## Key Takeaways

* Batch Normalization is a simple yet effective technique to improve training stability and speed in deep learning models.
* It mitigates vanishing and exploding gradients, allowing deeper networks to train effectively.
* While it adds computational overhead, the trade-off is usually worth it due to faster convergence and higher accuracy.
