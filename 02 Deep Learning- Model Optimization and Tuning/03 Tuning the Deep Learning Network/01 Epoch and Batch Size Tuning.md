### Epoch and Batch Size Tuning

**Overview:**
This section focuses on optimizing the two most common training hyperparameters for deep learning models: batch size and epochs.

**Batch Size:**

* A batch size represents a set of samples sent through the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) in a single pass.
* Input data is divided into multiple batches; each batch is processed to obtain predictions and update model parameters.
* Maximum batch size equals the total size of the input data.
* Common practice is to use batch sizes in powers of 2 (e.g., 16, 32, 64).
* Larger batch sizes improve GPU utilization and reduce training iterations, but may cause instability in gradient descent.
* Recommendation: Experiment to find the optimal batch size. A size of 32 is commonly effective for most use cases.

**Epochs:**

* Epochs represent the number of times the entire training dataset is passed through the network.
* Like batch size, epochs only control training progress and do not affect inference.
* Increasing epochs improves accuracy initially, but gains taper off as the model converges.
* Too many epochs may trigger instability and overfitting.
* Recommendation: Choose the earliest epoch value where accuracy stabilizes during training.

**Optimization Strategy:**

1. Experiment with different batch sizes to balance GPU utilization, training speed, and gradient stability.
2. Determine the optimal number of epochs by observing when model accuracy plateaus.
3. Once batch size and epochs are tuned, use these values for further hyperparameter experimentation.

**Next Step:**

* Apply these insights in practice by running experiments on the model and observing how batch size and epochs impact performance.
