Continuing your deep learning journey
- [Kumaran] Now that you have learned about the concepts and processes for optimizing deep learning models, you can take your learning even further. Explore additional topics in deep learning, including convolutional neural networks and recurrent neural networks. Analyze a deep learning problem in your work area and build a deep learning model to solve it. Optimize the deep learning problem with learnings from this course. Learn about scaling and serving machine learning models in production. Data always intrigues me. I bet it intrigues you too, so let's keep exploring it and find better ways of extracting knowledge out of it.
