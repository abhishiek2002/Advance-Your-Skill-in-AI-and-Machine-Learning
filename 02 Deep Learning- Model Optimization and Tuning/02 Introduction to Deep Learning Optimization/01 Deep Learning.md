### What is Deep Learning?

Deep learning is a specialized field within machine learning focused on building and using neural network models. Neural networks with more than three layers are typically categorized as deep learning networks.

Neural networks are inspired by the structure and function of the human brain. They consist of interconnected layers of nodes (or "neurons") that mimic the way humans process information and make decisions.

#### Key Points about Deep Learning:

1. **Structure**: Uses multiple layers in neural networks to learn complex patterns.
2. **Advancements**: Recent growth in deep learning is driven by large-scale data processing and the availability of GPUs for faster computation.
3. **Applications**:

   * **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: Ideal for unstructured text data.
   * **Speech Recognition and Synthesis**: Converts spoken words into text or generates human-like speech.
   * **Image Recognition**: Identifies and classifies objects in images.
   * **Self-Driving Cars**: Helps autonomous vehicles make decisions in real time.
   * **Healthcare, Customer Experience, Robotics**: Used for complex decision-making and pattern recognition.

Deep learning is especially suited for applications requiring the learning of complex behaviors and processing unstructured data. This course will focus on building optimized deep learning models for such applications.
