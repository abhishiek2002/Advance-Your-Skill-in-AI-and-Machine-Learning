## An ANN Model

### Overview

A neural network model (ANN) is defined by a combination of **parameters** and **hyperparameters**:

* **Parameters:** Weights and biases of all the nodes in the network.
* **Hyperparameters:** Network architecture and training controls, including:

  * Number of layers
  * Number of nodes in each layer
  * Activation functions
  * Cost (loss) functions
  * Learning rate
  * Optimizers

### Training an ANN Model

Training an ANN involves determining optimal values for both parameters and hyperparameters to maximize prediction accuracy.

#### Steps in Training:

1. **Prepare training data**: Include both independent (input) and dependent (output) variables.
2. **Initialize network architecture**: Start with an initial guess for the number of layers and nodes.
3. **Randomly initialize weights and biases**.
4. **Forward pass**: Apply weights and biases to inputs to compute outputs.
5. **Compute error**: Compare predicted output with actual values.
6. **Backpropagation**: Adjust weights and biases to reduce error.
7. **Iterate**: Repeat forward pass and backpropagation until the error reaches an acceptable threshold.
8. **Hyperparameter tuning**: Adjust network hyperparameters to improve training speed and convergence.
9. **Save model**: Store the trained network including both parameters and hyperparameters for future predictions.

### Goal

The goal of training an ANN is to create a model that accurately predicts outcomes for the given use case while optimizing performance and minimizing errors.
