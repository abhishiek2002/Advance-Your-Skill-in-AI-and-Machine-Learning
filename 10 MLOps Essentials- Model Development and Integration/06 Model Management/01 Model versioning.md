Model versioning
- [Instructor] In this chapter, we deal with MLOps around model management. We begin with a discussion on model versioning. As seen in the experiment tracking video in the earlier chapter, ML models evolve over time, as new training data is used and hyper parameters tuned. Tracking models with versions help establish lineage and manage its life cycle. Version control schemes should be similar to what is followed for software code. The specifics of the number of sub-versions and how version numbers change can be specific to your organization. Let's review the benefits of model versioning. Having version models along with data versions and code versions helps the team to establish baselines that link all the three versions. Given a model version, it's easy to see the input data that was used to build the model and the hyperparameters used. This helps in tracking and analyzing improvements in model performance. Version models can be easily referenced for integration and testing, and a given test cycle can stay with the same version until completed. Versioning also helps in model life cycle management, which we will discuss later in the chapter.
