Tools and technologies for model management
- [Instructor] Let's take a look at some of the tools and technologies available for model management. As with other tools we've discussed, this is a rapidly evolving landscape. So please do your own due diligence at the time of implementation to find the best set of tools. In terms of model registry, popular ML platforms like MLflow, Neptune and Weights and Biases provide the ability to store and track models. This includes model life cycle management also. For benchmarking, there are popular tools and libraries like MLPerf and DAWNBench. In addition, MLflow also has capabilities for benchmarking. AutoML is another rapidly evolving domain and products like Kubeflow and databricks are dating this domain now. When choosing tools, please do consider reducing the total number of tools deployed, as each tool requires its own administration, integration, and maintenance. As the ecosystem evolves, we can expect fewer tools which provide end-to-end MLOps capabilities.
