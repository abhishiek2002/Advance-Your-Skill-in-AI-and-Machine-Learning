Tools and technologies for training
- [Instructor] There has been incredible growth of tools in the area of model training in the past couple of years, and this will continue to explode in the near future. We will discuss some popular tools here, but it's highly recommended to scout the ecosystem for the best options when you actually start implementing MLOps. For model development, there are mature platforms like Python, its library ecosystem and Jupyter Notebooks. Source code control for software with tools like Git are also popular. For experiment management, there are multiple tools available, like Kubeflow and MLflow. Weights & Biases also specialize in this domain. For AutoML, there are, again, a number of tools coming up, the popular ones being Kubeflow and Databricks.
