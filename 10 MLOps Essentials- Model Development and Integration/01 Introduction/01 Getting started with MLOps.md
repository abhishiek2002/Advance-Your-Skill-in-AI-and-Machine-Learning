Getting started with MLOps
- [Instructor] The use of machine learning to improve personal lives and business outcomes has exploded in the past few years. An understanding of ML Labs is a critical skill for anyone involved in the building and managing of machine learning applications, including data scientists, engineers, managers, and product owners. My name is Kumaran Ponnambalam. In this course, I will introduce you to the essentials of ML Labs for model development and product integration. I will start off by discussing the overall ML Labs ecosystem and various activities involved in it. I will then discuss the aspects around requirements and design for building ML. Next, I will focus on applying ML Labs to data engineering and model training. I will progress further into the life cycle to using ML labs for model integration, as well as model management.
