Tools and technologies for data processing
- [Instructor] What tools and technologies exist that help in ML labs for data engineering? To begin with, we have popular big data processing technologies like Hadoop, Apache Spark and Apache Kafka. In addition to actual processing of data, they also have capabilities that help in control deployment, roll back, operations, logging, and change data capture. Next comes the set of databases for data storage. This includes RDBMS like MySQL, and NoSQL like MongoDB and Cassandra. These databases provide capabilities like resiliency, access control, recovery, schema management, and versioning at various levels and they should be leveraged for data management. Then there are also specific data versioning tools. A new breed of tools are coming up in this space, including DVC, lakeFS, and Neptune. Choose technologies that meet the requirements for the project and keep an eye on costs.
