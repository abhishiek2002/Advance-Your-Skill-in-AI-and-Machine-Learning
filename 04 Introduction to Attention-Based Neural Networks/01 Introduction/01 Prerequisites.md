Prerequisites
- [Instructor] Hi, and welcome to this course on Attention-based neural networks. This is an introductory course on Attention-based models. There are definitely some prereqs that you need to have to make the most of your learning. This is definitely not a beginner deep learning course. Now, here is what I expect that you already know. I expect that you already have a basic understanding of how neural networks work. You understand the training of a neural network, back propagation, gradient descent, the entire details. It would also help for you to have some understanding of transfer learning using pre-trained models, specifically image classification models, because you'll be using those in our hands-on demos. Now, as far as the demos are concerned, I hope you're comfortable programming in Python and you're comfortable building and training neural networks using the PyTorch framework.
