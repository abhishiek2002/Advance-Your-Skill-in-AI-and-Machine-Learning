GANs: Generating new worlds
- Are you curious about the world of generative AI and how machines and apps can create images? Are you interested in using the technology yourself so you can create your own art? My name is Martin Kemka, and over the last 15 years, I've worked as a machine learning researcher in the field of applied machine learning. So join me on this course about generative adversarial networks where we'll talk about where GANs came from, how they're made, and where they're headed. Let's get started.


What you should know
- This course contains a number of presentations and also a number of coding exercises. So a background in programming, specifically Python programming, would be really helpful. A background in data science and machine learning will also be helpful but not necessarily required.
