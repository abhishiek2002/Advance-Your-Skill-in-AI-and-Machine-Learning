Course outline and prerequisites
With the introduction out of the way, let's take a look at what you'll actually cover in this AI workshop. Will be hands-on training generative adversarial networks with DNNs or dense neural networks. We'll start off by viewing and exploring the image training data for a generative model. The image dataset that we'll be working with is the Fashion-MNIST dataset. We'll then understand how generative adversarial networks work. You need to understand the concepts of the discriminator and the generator before you can actually work with the building blocks of GANs. We'll then discuss in some detail the loss function that we'll use with a generative adversarial network, the minimax loss function. And then finally, we'll build and train again using DNNs or dense neural networks. This is not a beginner course in neural networks, so here are some prereqs that you need to have to make the most of your learning. We'll be writing code in Python, so you should be comfortable programming in Python. You should be familiar with neural networks and how they work. So if you've built and trained neural network models, that's perfect. We'll be using PyTorch for neural network training. So it's important that you're comfortable programming using the PyTorch framework.
