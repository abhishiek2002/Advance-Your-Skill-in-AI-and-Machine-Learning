Summary and next steps
And this brings us to the very end of this AI workshop: Hands-on with GANs using dense neural networks. Here is what we covered in this training. We first explored the image training data for a generative model. We then understood how generative adversarial networks work. We worked with both the generator and the discriminator, train them separately. These are the building blocks of GANs. We then understood how GAN loss functions work, and we dive deep into the minimax loss function. And finally, we built and trained our GAN using a dense neural network. This brings us to the very end of this workshop. And here are some other resources on LinkedIn learning that you might find interesting. There is a follow-up workshop that you can take after this one, where we'll talk about hands-on GANs using deep convolutional networks. You can think of this workshop as a prereq for this next one here. Well, that's it from me here today. I hope you enjoyed this workshop. Thank you for listening.
