Semantic coding for emotion
- I know that sometimes when you're writing code, you have to put your emotions into your background, basically in the back of your mind. And that's why when a user error occurs that sounds like user error doesn't sound very catastrophic. Or actually, the user never makes a mistake, the app makes the mistake. But anyways. So, let's imagine we're going to cook a semantic function that is about, "define empathy for issue." Well, define is kind of a weird word, isn't it? But let's try that. "This is going to help us critically think by activating our emotional stuff," feelings. Okay. Should have called it like make me feel. Okay. So, let's write a prompt that can help us do that. Say, "The following feature has been released to a set of people who are new to computers. The error message reads as following: When they make a mistake, describe the emotional reaction that they have." Okay, so what's happening here? We are going to make the machine feel for us, which sounds kind of ridiculous. But again, when you're in the zone, it's hard to remember that this is being used by people. So, let's run the function. The error message says, "You are missing the key.env file for this to run. Terminate." Okay. I don't know, like how are they going to react to this one? Let's see. That's a pretty good message if you ask me. Like they're missing the .env file, so just stop working. "The people who are new to computers may feel frustrated and overwhelmed with this error message. They may feel confused and unsure of what to do next, and may be intimidated by tech," oh, really? Well, they should have read the manual, as we say when we write stuff. If you get my drift here. But let's make it even more evocative. "They have and provide the work and family context they may be experiencing when this message lands." Okay. This is kind of like, "Okay, now let's sort of like illustrate not how they feel but what situation are they in." Remember, like, because of remote work or blended work or hybrid work, "The," how about this one? "You have forgotten the .env file. Terminate." Okay. All right. Let's see how people react. Let's see here. They may be telling yourself, "Well, you're asking a generative AI to do this for you?" Well, in reality, you should actually test it on real people, use a research, you know? Get like a sample group to do this with and hear what they say. "The person may feel frustrated. They may be feeling the stress of trying to balance work and family responsibilities." That sound familiar? I kind of think so. There's a reason why they feel this. It's the context they're in. And so, consider this way of working with AI a key to basically writing this kind of code and testing different ideas in it. And, you know, helping the AI help you feel. Let's do another one, shall we? Okay. Now, let's describe this differently. "The following feature has been released for people who are experts in accounting software." This is a different group of people. Their message reads as following when they make a mistake. Let's try this with a different group of people. Let's try the emotional reaction they have. And let's remove that context. Here we go. "Missing numerical information on line 12. Input again." Okay. Now, we're kind of asking it like, "Well, this time they're not beginners, maybe they are feeling different about it." The experts, they feel frustrated. Even expert feels frustrated. "Time is being wasted." Notice how an expert is like, "Hey, this is my time." And so, now, when you're developing the system, you're thinking, "Oh, hold it." They're losing time, and time is the most valuable thing. They're not being efficient. So that's another way to like look at the problem. So, really use this kind of AI to build copilots that are more empathetic to different groups of users. Use it like a calculator for emotion. So when you're creating the feature, about to ship it, you're asking questions like, how's someone going to feel when they use this? Because the copilots have to enable the pilot to succeed. We've come a long way. We're going to go a little further by doing the thing you probably don't want to hear. We're going to add more friction as we're getting towards the end. Let's learn why adding friction is so key in collaborative UX.
