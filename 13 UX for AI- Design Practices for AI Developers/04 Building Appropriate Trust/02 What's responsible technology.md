What's responsible technology?
- Last week I was in San Francisco at a special art opening of an exhibit at a place called the Exploratorium. It was founded by Frank Oppenheimer who is one of the particle physicists who famously worked on the Manhattan Project. The incredible project that created the nuclear bomb. Now, how did a particle physicist end up having an art museum about science in particular? It's because many scientists who worked during World War II to create weapons of mass destruction, either during or after, ask questions about what is science for if it can't protect human life? And when you think about Joseph Weizenbaum, my AI professor I mentioned, who created the first chat bot, he fled Nazi Germany as a youth. And that's when he made this chat bot, he became afraid of what happens if this is in the wrong hands. We always tend to think critically after something bad has happened. That's why we call it criticism and it sounds really negative, but right now, luckily, a lot of people, corporations, individuals, education institutions, governments, we're thinking critically before something could happen negatively with AI. That's a good thing. But I believe this is the first time where the very thing we're afraid of could possibly help us figure out ahead of time, improve our critical thinking, think slowly before something happens that we don't want to occur. So instead of blah, blah, blah, let's jump into code as we close off this course.
