# Boosting in Machine Learning

## Overview

Boosting is another **ensemble learning technique**, different from bagging. While bagging builds multiple models in parallel on different subsets of data, boosting builds models **sequentially** where each model focuses on the mistakes of the previous one. The idea is to start with a weak learner and gradually improve it by learning from errors.

Boosting methods are considered **very powerful algorithms**, often used in practice for achieving state-of-the-art results.

## Key Idea of Boosting

* Start with a **weak learner** (usually a decision stump â€“ a very shallow decision tree).
* Train the weak learner on the data.
* Identify where it makes **mistakes**.
* Train the next weak learner to focus on correcting those mistakes.
* Repeat the process, building a sequence of models.
* Final prediction = **weighted combination** of all weak learners.

Unlike bagging (parallel + independent learners), boosting builds learners **sequentially** with each one correcting the previous one.

## AdaBoost (Adaptive Boosting)

AdaBoost was one of the first and most influential boosting algorithms.

### Steps:

1. Assign **equal weights** to all training samples (rows).
2. Train a weak learner (e.g., shallow decision tree).
3. Identify misclassified samples â†’ **increase their weights**.

   * Harder-to-predict points get more influence in the next round.
4. Train the next weak learner using updated weights.
5. Repeat until the desired number of weak learners is built.
6. Final model = **weighted vote** of all weak learners.

ðŸ‘‰ Advantage: Focuses learning power on **difficult cases**.

## Gradient Boosting

Gradient Boosting extends the idea of boosting with **gradient descent optimization**.

### Steps:

1. Start with a weak model.
2. Calculate **residuals** (errors = actual value â€“ predicted value).
3. Train a new weak learner on the residuals.

   * New modelâ€™s goal = **fix previous modelâ€™s errors**.
4. Add the new model to the ensemble.
5. Repeat this process.

ðŸ‘‰ The model learns **iteratively by reducing residual errors**, just like optimization in gradient descent.

## Difference Between AdaBoost and Gradient Boosting

| Feature             | AdaBoost                                   | Gradient Boosting                       |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------- |
| Error Handling      | Increases weights for misclassified points | Fits new learners on residuals (errors) |
| Optimization Method | Weight adjustment                          | Gradient descent on loss function       |
| Final Prediction    | Weighted vote of weak learners             | Sequential error correction             |

## Summary

* Boosting = Sequential ensemble learning.
* AdaBoost = Weight misclassified samples â†’ focus on difficult data points.
* Gradient Boosting = Train on residuals using gradient descent â†’ more flexible and powerful.
* Both are widely used, with **Gradient Boosting (and its variants like XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost)** being among the most powerful algorithms in machine learning today.
