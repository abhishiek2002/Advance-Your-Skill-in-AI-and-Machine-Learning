---

## 📈 What You Will Learn

By the end of this course, you will:

* ✅ Understand **how ensembles work**
* ✅ Harness their power to build **more accurate and reliable models**

---

## 💡 Quick Insight: Why Ensembles Work

Ensemble methods combine multiple models (often called *weak learners*) to produce a **stronger model**.

Think of it like **asking multiple experts for their opinion** instead of relying on just one:

* If one expert is wrong, others can correct it.
* The combined opinion is usually **more accurate** than any single expert.

---

## 📌 Key Takeaway

* **Random Forest** and **XGBoost** are popular ensemble techniques that dominate in both competitions and practical real-world applications.
* Ensemble Learning helps reduce **variance**, **bias**, and improves **generalization**.
