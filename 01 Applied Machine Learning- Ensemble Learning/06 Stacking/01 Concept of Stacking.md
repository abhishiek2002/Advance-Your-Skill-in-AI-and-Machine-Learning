## Concept of Stacking

**Overview:**
In this section, we explore **stacking**, a powerful ensemble technique used to improve predictive performance by combining multiple models.

### What is Stacking?

* Stacking, also called **stacked generalization**, is an ensemble technique.
* It combines multiple models, referred to as **base models**, to improve predictions.
* A **metamodel** (or second-level model) uses the predictions of base models to make a final prediction.

### How Stacking Works

1. **Train Base Models:**

   * Multiple base models are trained independently on the same dataset.
   * Base models can be of different types, e.g., decision trees, linear models, neural networks, nearest neighbors, etc.

2. **Generate Predictions:**

   * Each base model makes predictions on the data.
   * These predictions form a new dataset.

3. **Train Metamodel:**

   * The metamodel takes the predictions from the base models as input.
   * It learns how to best combine these predictions to produce a final prediction.

### Advantages of Stacking

* Captures **different aspects** of complex data.
* Maximizes **accuracy** by leveraging multiple models.
* Flexible with respect to the types of base models used.

### Drawbacks

* **Reduced interpretability:** The final model can be difficult to explain.
* Increased **complexity** and computational cost.

**Usage Tip:**

* Use stacking when accuracy is more critical than model interpretability.
* Ideal for datasets where different models capture different patterns effectively.
