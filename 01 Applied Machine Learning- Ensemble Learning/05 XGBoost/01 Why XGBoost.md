## Why XGBoost?

XGBoost, short for e**X**treme **G**radient Boosting, is one of the most popular machine learning tools for tabular data. Here's why it stands out:

### Key Advantages of XGBoost:

1. **Speed**:

   * Designed for high performance.
   * Uses **parallel processing** and **histogram-based learning** to process data faster than other libraries, including scikit-learn.

2. **Overfitting Prevention**:

   * Built-in **regularization techniques** (L1 and L2) help prevent overfitting.
   * Scikit-learn's gradient boosting lacks these regularization controls.

3. **Scalability**:

   * Handles very large datasets efficiently.
   * Supports **distributed computing**, allowing scaling beyond a single machine.

4. **Flexibility with Objective Functions**:

   * Supports regression, classification, and ranking problems.
   * Users can define **custom objective functions**.

5. **Handles Missing Data Natively**:

   * Automatically manages missing values without needing preprocessing pipelines.

6. **Handles Categorical Features**:

   * Simplifies modeling without complex preprocessing steps.

### Summary:

XGBoost combines **speed, regularization, flexibility, and performance**, making it a go-to tool for data scientists when working with tabular datasets.

Next, we'll see a practical demonstration of using XGBoost.
