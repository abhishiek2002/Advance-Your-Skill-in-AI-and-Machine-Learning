Deep reinforcement learning
- [Instructor] In the course so far, we have considered reinforcement learning in its most basic form, understanding how it all works, the way an agent learns in a state, how the action values for each action is taught in the Q-Table. We also know that for the agent to perform well and take better actions, it needs to have tried many many actions to have learned properly. Now think of this many actions that the agent needs to keep track of in the Q-Table. How big could the Q-Table possibly be? Yeah, very, very big. And that's where deep learning comes in, to help make reinforcement learning more effective, and makes it easier to handle the larger information space. The neural network takes as inputs the information that the agent has on the environment, and all possible actions that can be taken in the states, and predicts the reward for every possible action, before taking an action. This removes the trial and error stages, and frequent updates of the action values, as done in basic reinforcement learning with the Q-Table. This is one major improvement in reinforcement learning, that should be learnt, if you are an AI developer, or researcher who uses reinforcement learning.
