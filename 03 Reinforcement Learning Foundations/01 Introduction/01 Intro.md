Reinforcement learning in a nutshell
- Picture this. An algorithm mastering the game of chess through trial and error, gradually improving its strategies with every move. That is the essence of reinforcement learning, a dynamic process where machines learn by interacting with the world, receiving feedback and refining their actions. In this course, we'll delve into the foundations of reinforcement learning, unraveling core concepts that drive machines to explore their environment, learn from experiences and make intelligent decisions. I'm Khaulat, the founder of DiverseK where we're passionate about bridging the gap between tech talent and companies. We'll delve into the key methods like the Monte Carlo method and the temporal-difference methods including SARSA, Q-learning and Expected SARSA. Let's dive right in.
