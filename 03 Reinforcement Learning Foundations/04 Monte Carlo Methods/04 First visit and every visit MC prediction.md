First visit and every visit MC prediction
- [Instructor] First-visit and every-visit Monte-Carlo prediction, splits the Monte-Carlo prediction into two types. For every policy when predicting the reward, we can encounter a state more than once. It is then our decision to make if the second, third or fourth time we encounter a state should be taken into consideration when estimating the reward. For example, if the agent visit state two for the first time at the second time step and then passes state two again at the eighth time step, if we take into consideration the second time it's passes, we get a different reward from if it isn't considered. So, if the agent decides to go with the first-visit Monte-Carlo prediction, the expected reward will be the cumulative reward from the second time step to the goal without minding the second visit to the state at the eighth time step. But if the agent says to follow the every-visit Monte-Carlo prediction, it's also is the expected reward, which is the cumulative reward from the second time step to the goal. However, for the second state, now we have two different rewards, for the second time step and eighth time step. So we use the average of both. If the agent visits the state more than two times and this following the every-visit Monte-Carlo prediction, the average expected reward will be gotten for the three or more time steps. Every-visit prediction has been seen to be biased which makes the first-visit method better option.
