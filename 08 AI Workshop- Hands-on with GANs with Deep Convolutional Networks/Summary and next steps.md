Summary and next steps
We've come to the end of this course. Let's take a quick look at what we covered here in this AI workshop. We first understood how convolutional neural networks work, and we understood the working of the convolutional layer and the pooling layer. We then saw how we could use the discriminator as a classification model. And then we put everything together and we built and trained the GAN using a deep convolutional network. If generative AI is something that you're interested in, here is another course on LinkedIn that you might find interesting. Generative AI: Working with Large Language Models. Well, it's time for me to say goodbye. I hope you enjoyed this workshop. Thank you for listening.
