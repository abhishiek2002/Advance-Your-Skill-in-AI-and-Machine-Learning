Understanding responsible AI
- [Narrator] Artificial intelligence is everywhere. AI is used in almost every industry and affects people's daily lives, from housing to healthcare, and even banking and transportation. So it's important to understand how these systems make decisions and what steps can be taken to improve the fairness and equity of those decisions. Responsible AI is all about thoughtful consideration, documentation, and alternative development tactics to reduce the harms caused by AI systems. Throughout my LinkedIn learning course we'll look at real world examples to help reinforce your understanding of the terminology and processes used in AI. Hi, I'm Ayodele Odubela, data scientist, AI realist, and responsible AI entrepreneur. I spent the last seven years doing analytics, data science, and machine learning work. And I'm so excited to share my knowledge and expertise on the topic of responsible AI with you. Join me as we dive into the world of machine learning and responsible AI.
